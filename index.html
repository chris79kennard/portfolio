      About me
      <p>
        I was born in 1994 in Corpus Christi Texas, but raised in Austin Texas
        for most of my teen years. Through out my life I have always strived to
        be great at everything I put my mind to and I dont intend on that
        changing while taking this program at the Universtiy of Texas at Austin.
        Trying something new and failing is somthing I am not afriad of becasue
        I know im learing and growing, its all aprart of the process. And that
        applies to this program as well, but I know I will come out on top! Ive
        taught my self how to be more articulate, dispite growing up with a
        learing disablilty in ADHD. I have tought my self skills that no one
        around me or in my personal cirlce could teach me, such as how to create
        and edit YouTube videos and amass over 5 thousand followers in my first
        8 months of starting the channel but I did it. Or how to learn graphic
        design from ground zero to start my own small in house business, but I
        did it. Ive taught my self numerous skills. But this is diffrent. This
        is a new chapter in the feild of I.T and it will require some assitance
        from others and thats okay. Working with others will teach me the ropes
        of this broad job field and help me hone my newly acquired devopler
        skills to the best of my ability. It short time I will be a devopler and
        you will be hearing from me. feel free to follow along as my skills
        progress on this site. Applications coming your way soon!
